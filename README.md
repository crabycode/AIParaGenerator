This is the fifth final project I made for finishing my codedex journey:
"The Legend of Python"
It is an AI model, using openAI that returns response to "Write a paragraph about the following topic: " and asks you weather you want it to write another one, until answered anything different from yes.
*Update I didn't include any images of it working, because I am using Pycharm and it doesn't work with the updated version of the library openai, but if you run the code in VS it will work.
